# Credit-Risk-modeling-using-machine-learning-
## Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict credit risk, helping financial institutions assess the likelihood of loan default. By analyzing borrower data and financial metrics, the model classifies applicants into low-risk and high-risk categories, aiding in effective decision-making.
----
## **Features**

Predictive classification of credit risk as "low-risk" or "high-risk."

Data preprocessing techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.

Implementation of various machine learning algorithms for comparison (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).

Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Insights into key features influencing credit risk through feature importance analysis.

Technologies Used

Programming Languages: Python

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, LightGBM

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Excel/CSV for data handling
-----
## **Dataset**

The dataset used for training and testing is sourced from publicly available repositories such as Kaggle or institutional databases. It includes features such as:

Demographic Information: Age, gender, employment status

Financial Metrics: Income, credit history, loan amount, debt-to-income ratio

Loan Details: Purpose, term, and installment

Ensure the dataset is structured as follows:

/dataset
  train.csv
  test.csv

Prerequisites

Python 3.7+

Install necessary libraries:

pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn xgboost lightgbm

## **Installation**

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/username/credit-risk-modeling.git

Navigate to the project directory: cd credit-risk-modeling

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

## **Usage**

Data Preprocessing:Run the script to clean, impute missing values, and scale features:

python preprocess.py

Model Training:Train various models and save the best-performing one:

python train.py

Model Evaluation:Test the trained model on the test dataset and generate evaluation metrics:

python evaluate.py

Risk Prediction:Use the trained model to predict risk for new applicants:

python predict.py --input <path_to_new_data>

## **Results**

**Best Model: XGBoost achieved the highest performance with:**

**Accuracy: 91.5%**

**Precision: 89.3%**

**Recall: 92.7%**

**F1-score: 91.0%**

**ROC-AUC: 94.2%**

Visualizations include confusion matrices, feature importance plots, and ROC curves (available in the results/ directory).

## **Future Enhancements**

Incorporate deep learning models (e.g., ANN) for improved accuracy.

Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or Bayesian Optimization.

Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI for real-time risk assessment.
